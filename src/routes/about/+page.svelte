			About This Project
		</h2>

			<p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl">
				It started with a chaotic semester at Crescent Institute of Technology. A small group of
				engineering students grew frustrated with the constant registration struggles—unreliable
				systems, unclear processes, and endless delays. Determined to fix it, we decided to take
				matters into our own hands.
			</p>
			<p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl">
				What began as a late-night brainstorming session evolved into this web app. Fueled by a
				shared passion for problem-solving and technology, we built a platform to simplify event
				registration and student onboarding. One of us focused on crafting an intuitive interface,
				another tackled the technical backbone, and together we refined the design to make it
				seamless.
			</p>
			<p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl">
				This project is more than just code—it’s our commitment to improving the student experience.
				We’ve created a tool that cuts through the clutter, letting you focus on what really
				matters: your education and your journey.
